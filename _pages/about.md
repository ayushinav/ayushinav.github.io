I'm a second year Phd student in [Earth and Atmospheric Science](https://eas.gatech.edu/) at [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/). Prior to joining Georgia Tech, I received my Integrated Masters of Technology in [Applied Geophysics](https://www.iitism.ac.in) from [Indian Institute of Technology (Indian School of Mines) Dhanbad](https://www.iitism.ac.in/index.php/Departments/dept_agp).

I am interested in imaging the earth primarily via electromagnetic methods. This can lead to applications in carbon capture (CCS), geothermal reservoirs, groundwater quality monitoring, properties of mantle and deeper earth. To bring these to effect, my research is inclined towards (but not limited to) geophysical inverse problems, scientific machine learning, uncertainty quantification and mixing information from different types of datasets.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
