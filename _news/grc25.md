I am selected for an oral presentation at "Constraining the upper mantle properties in the Pacific seafloor using MT and seismic data " at the Grodon Research Seminar and will present a poster on the same topic in the corresponding Gordon Research Conference on "Interiors of the Earth (Volatiles, Melt and Viscosity)".
